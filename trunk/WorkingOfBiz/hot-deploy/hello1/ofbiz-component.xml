What is this file telling OFBiz?

    * That we have a component named "hello1"
    * That it should use the "main" resource-loader
    * That it has one web application, also called "hello1"
    * The "hello1" web application should use the "default-server" web server
    * The "hello1" web application is inside the webapp/ directory
    * The "hello1" web application should be mounted at a URI of "/hello1"
    * We don't want the app-bar, which shows all the applications available in OFBiz, to be displayed in our web app
    
The ofbiz-component file is responsible for letting OFBiz know where resources are at as well as allowing you to add to the classpath.    
a) name :- defines the name of our web application.
b) title :- This will be the title of our component
c) server :- This will let OFBiz know what server to use
d) base-permission :- This line requires that the user should have the OFBTOOLS permission to be able to use the application. Since the 'admin' user has this permission we do not have to create any new users.
e) location :- This will be the location that is the default base directory for the server
f) mount-point :- This is the URL used to access this resource. in this case it would be localhost:8080/practice
g) app-bar-display :- This will let OFBiz know if we want our component to show up in the main application tabs that are part of the common ofbiz decorator.
